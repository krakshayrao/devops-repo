Open Source Software
====================

Open Source Software (OSS) is source code that is freely available for modification, combination, and distribution. OSS is generally free to acquire but it can be costly to validate, support, and maintain. It's best identified by reference to its particular licensing terms which must be complied with and therefore involve unique business and legal risks which must be reviewed.

When you use OSS, you enter into a legally binding license agreement. These agreements incur varying obligations, from providing notice to giving access to proprietary code owned by Caterpillar. Violating these agreements can lead to damages, injunctions, design changes, and damage to our reputation.

Regardless of where you find software/code, whether it's on a public web site, a blog, Stack Overflow, GitHub, in a video, or anywhere else, it is protected by copyright. You should make an attempt to understand the license before using the code.  If no license can be discovered, then the code shouldn't be used.

Open source licenses apply to more than just software/code. Here are some examples of other types of licensed content that you may use in the process of developing software:

* Fonts
* Images
* CSS/HTML
* Documentation
* Binaries/Executables (e.g. freeware, shareware, demos)
* Azure DevOps Extensions
* Types of Open Source Licenses


There are a couple major types of open source licenses:

Permissive :
    Guarantees the freedom to use, modify, and redistribute as well as proprietary derivative works.  These licenses place minimal restrictions on how they can be used.
Copyleft : 
    The author(s) make a claim on the copyright of the work and other people have the right to use, modify, and share the work as long as the original obligation is maintained.  In simplest terms, users must make their code open for use by others as well.​​​​​​​


If you have the flexibility to choose an OSS library with a permissive license over a copyleft license, you should.

Why Should Developers Care?
===========================


It's cheaper and faster to ensure compliance the first time, than it is to deal with it later if found in violation.



As an example, several years ago, Caterpillar was notified of unlicensed fonts that were used in several different mobile applications. Caterpillar had to pay the licensing fee in addition to penalties for improper usage.



What originally would have cost $5,000 to license the font for 5 different apps ended up costing...

**Legal Penalties:** $70,000

**Licensing Cost:** $5,000

**Discovery/Work Effort (legal and staff time):** $20,000+

**Totalling:** $95,000+  


If you're using OSS, please use the `Open Source Approval Tool <http://ossapproval.cat.com/>`_. All submissions are specific to your use case and are not global approvals. If you are submitting something with a copyleft license, it will typically require the Legal Services organization's review.
